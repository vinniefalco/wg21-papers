## Revision History

### R0: August 2026

- Initial version.

---

## 1. Introduction

P3846R1<sup>[1]</sup> responds to 18 concerns raised by national bodies and individual papers about C++26 contract assertions as specified in P2900R14<sup>[2]</sup>. Has anyone verified whether the concerns were suitably addressed? This paper does.

---

## 2. The Scorecard

Each response in P3846R1 falls into one of four categories based on what the cited sources show.

| Rating | Concerns | Count | Share |
|---|---|---|---|
| Contradicted by own sources | 12, 15, 18 | 3 | 17% |
| Unverified assertion or procedural argument | 1, 5, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17 | 7 | 39% |
| Partial evidence, conclusion overreaches | 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 | 6 | 33% |
| Answered with verifiable evidence | 8, 10 | 2 | 11% |

Eleven percent of P3846R1's responses are fully supported by the evidence they cite.

## 3. What the Sources Show

The concerns below are ordered from those whose responses are contradicted by the cited sources to those whose responses are supported. For each, one sentence states what P3846R1 claims, and one sentence states what the cited source shows.

### Contradicted by own sources

- **Concern 12 (static analysis).** P3846R1 states that CodeQL is "already actively pursuing support for P2900 contract assertions," citing the Martin25 CppCon talk. P3893R0<sup>[3]</sup>, authored by the same CodeQL engineer who co-presented that talk, states: "the portions of this talk presented by GitHub are not an endorsement of P2900" and the prototype targets traditional assertions, not P2900 contract specifiers.

- **Concern 15 (future features).** P3846R1 states that "in more than four decades of C++ evolution, no proposal for deep const has ever been brought forward." P1974R0<sup>[4]</sup> (Gao, 2020) proposes `propconst`, a language-level deep-const qualifier, and received EWG encouragement with strong consensus.

- **Concern 18 (stdlib hardening).** P3846R1 states that "both the libc++ and libstdc++ implementation currently being planned" will implement hardening on top of P2900. Jonathan Wakely, the libstdc++ maintainer, co-authored P3878R0<sup>[7]</sup>, whose title is "C++26 Contracts are not a good fit for standard library hardening." P3846R1 cites RU-016 as support for keeping hardening on contracts but does not note that RU-016 was rejected (N5031<sup>[8]</sup>) or that four other NB comments argued for decoupling.

### Unverified assertion or procedural argument

- **Concern 14 (missing features).** P3846R1 states that "no proposals [for the requested features] gained consensus in EWG." P3097R0<sup>[9]</sup> (virtual function contracts) gained strong EWG consensus of 33 in favor and 3 against in St. Louis and was adopted into the C++26 working draft before being removed at the next meeting in Hagenberg.

- **Concern 11 (exceptions as violations).** P3846R1 states that its approach is "the only known solution" satisfying both the no-escape and recovery constituencies. P3626R0<sup>[10]</sup> proposes unconditional propagation and P3909R0<sup>[11]</sup> proposes a build-mode option, both documented alternatives. The EWG Hagenberg poll on this question was 30 for change vs. 22 against, which P3846R1 characterizes as both SG21 and EWG concluding the concern was "unsound."

- **Concern 6 (implementation-defined).** P3846R1 states that "P2900 introduces exactly five implementation-defined properties." The C++ standard's own implementation-defined behavior index<sup>[12]</sup> lists seven contract-related entries; the paper omits the `comment` field contents, `location` field contents, and whether `contract_violation` has a virtual destructor.

- **Concern 1 (safety).** P3846R1 asserts that the ability to ignore assertions is "a prerequisite for widespread adoption" and cites "decades of successful use of C assert." No study, survey, or usage data links the NDEBUG mechanism to assert's adoption. Rust's non-ignorable bounds checking has not prevented adoption.

- **Concern 17 (deployment experience).** Every deployment claim traces to a closed loop: the P2900 authors implemented their own proposal in GCC and Clang, deployed it on codebases they control (BDE, LLVM), aligned the library infrastructure they maintain (libc++ hardening) with P2900 semantics, then cited all of this as independent validation. No assessment from an implementer outside the author list appears in the record. Six of the seven evidence papers (P3460R0, P3336R0, P3268R0, P3276R0, P3191R0, and the Boost.Build example) are authored or co-authored by P3846R1 co-signatories.

- **Concern 5 (modules).** P3846R1 asserts that modules could carry contract-evaluation semantics in BMIs. No implementation demonstrates this. The response is four paragraphs of theoretical reasoning.

- **Concern 13 (complexity).** P3846R1 states the feature is "orders of magnitude simpler to support than modules, concepts, reflection, or even lambdas." P3460R0<sup>[13]</sup>, the cited source, confirms the implementations were straightforward but contains no comparison to other features. The phrase "orders of magnitude" appears to come from oral testimony not recorded in the cited paper.

- **Concern 16 (decomposition).** P3846R1 states that P1893R0's decomposition approach was "subsequently shown to be inadequate." P2899R1<sup>[14]</sup>, the rationale paper, does not mention P1893R0. No published analysis of P1893R0's adequacy was found in the WG21 record.

### Partial evidence, conclusion overreaches

- **Concern 4 (ODR).** P3846R1 states that "both Clang (LLVMPR26774) and GCC (GCCBug70018) disabled [interprocedural optimizations on inline functions] nearly a decade ago." GCC bug 70018<sup>[5]</sup> was fixed in GCC 7 (2017), confirming the GCC claim. LLVM bug 27796<sup>[6]</sup> is a user complaint about lost optimization from the Clang fix, contradicting P3846R1's claim that "Clang made this tradeoff long ago without user complaints." The same class of bug resurfaced with contracts (GCCBug121936<sup>[15]</sup>), which P3846R1 characterizes as "unrelated to contract assertions" despite the contracts implementation carrying a dedicated workaround for it.

- **Concern 2 (cross-TU semantics).** P3846R1 lists five implementation strategies; three are evidenced (naive in GCC/Clang, link-time deferral prototyped in GCC, ABI proof-of-concept at efcs/contracts-abi). The stated conclusion that "the worst case is an assertion goes unchecked" is contradicted by P3846R1's own Concern 4, which documents a case where mixed mode triggered miscompilation worse than an unchecked assertion (GCCBug121936<sup>[15]</sup>).

- **Concern 9 (global handlers).** P3846R1's historical claims are evidenced (per-assertion handlers were explored and abandoned; std::unexpected was removed as part of eliminating dynamic exception specs). The analogies to Qt and game engines are asserted without evidence of those facilities being "successful." The strongest available evidence for a global violation handler - Bloomberg BDE's 20-year deployment - goes uncited in this section.

- **Concern 3 (dependency management).** Boost.Build adding contracts support in under an hour is evidenced by a public commit, but the B2 maintainer is a P3846R1 co-author (Ren&eacute; Ferdinand Rivera Morell). No other build system (CMake, Meson, Bazel) has added support.

- **Concern 7 (uncheckable guidelines).** P3499R1<sup>[16]</sup> demonstrates that enforcing side-effect-freedom would render most expressions ill-formed, and Sutter &amp; Alexandrescu Rule 68 exists and says what P3846R1 claims. The assertion that side-effect bugs are "rarely an issue" in decades of practice has no empirical backing; CERT PRE31-C and static-analysis rules (SonarQube S3346, PVS-Studio V6055) exist to catch this bug class.

- **Concern 6 (implementation-defined, cont'd).** The GCC/Clang comparison table is largely accurate. SG15 stating no tooling concerns is confirmed by three independent sources. The count error noted above sits inside an otherwise partially supported response.

### Answered with verifiable evidence

- **Concern 8 (const-ification).** Const-ification applied to BDE found six assignment-vs-equality bugs (P3336R0<sup>[17]</sup>); applied to LLVM found approximately 75 const-correctness defects (P3460R0<sup>[13]</sup>); no opposing paper produced a counter-example. The SG21 adoption poll was 16 in favor, 0 against (SF 6, F 10, N 3, A 0, SA 0).

- **Concern 10 (consecutive assertions).** The `&&` short-circuit idiom is a working mitigation for the canonical case. The launchMissiles counter-example is logically valid. SG21 rejected auto-skipping with SF 0, F 0, N 1, A 13, SA 7 - including the author of the proposal.

## 4. Conclusion

P3846R1 addresses 18 objections. Verification against the paper's own cited sources finds two responses supported by independently verifiable evidence. The committee record does not support treating the remaining sixteen as settled.

The author provides information and serves at the pleasure of the committee.

This paper asks for nothing.
